## Tag

In HTML, tags are the commands that compose the language.

These tags give meaning to our content, so the Browser, or any other web application knows how to process this data. For example, a search engine like Google needs to know what is a title, or what is a paragraph, or an image to be able to make a ranking of relevance between what you want and what it has found in pages 

Before we see any tags, we first need to understand how the syntax of html works.

First, tags comes start with the `<` signal and end with the `>` signal, eg:

```html
<img>
```

Second, most tags have a tag pair, which means they have an opening tag and a matching closing one. In the example below we have a paragraph tag with a content between the opening and the closing tags, in this case, the text of paragraph.

```html
<p>Lorem ipsum</p>
```
